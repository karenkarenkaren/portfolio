    <h1>My resume</h1>
    <h2>Profile and ambition</h2>
    <p>I am an energetic and committed person. I thrive in environments where there is room for innovation and creativity, where team members get responsibilities and the opportunity to grow. 

        As a professional I want to generate socially relevant impact. Particularly in the field of technology, many are still lagging behind. I would like to contribute to closing this digital literacy gap. Connecting the dots between all stakeholders to co-create easy-to-use solutions is what I like most.
        
        I am looking for a challenging job in which I can combine my soft skills  with an intellectual challenge. I am willing to follow a learning path in a powerful and positive environment.
        </p>
